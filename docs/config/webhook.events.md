# Webhook Event Definitions

Here is a list of every accepted event for inclusion in the 'webhook event' settings. These correspond pretty directly to the configurations in the messages config.

::: warning Specifying Events â‰  Enabling Messages
Adding an event to be send for a webhook does not enable Discord Connector to send that event. It only tells Discord Connector *where* to send the event message.

Messages for these events have to be enabled in the toggles config file (as they were previously). Any of these messages which are enabled by default are notated as such in the 'Enabled by Default' column.

Take note that by default, the webhooks are set to 'ALL' which takes any messages which happen and sends them.

## General Events

These include player, server, and random events.

:::tip Special Case Events
Take note that some of these events are subsets of the [special cases](/config/webhook.events.html#special-case-events)
