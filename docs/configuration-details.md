# Configuration in Detail

The details on where configuration settings are and what they do: how to fine-tune your configuration.

DiscordConnector uses multiple configuration files to make find the setting you want to change faster, and hopefully easier. The configuration is divided into the following files:

| Configuration File                                    | Details                 | Purpose                                                                                                                     |

| Allow positions to be sent     | true    | Set to false to prevent any positions/coordinates from being sent, even if you have enabled some in toggles. If this is true, it can be overridden per message in the toggles config file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Collect stats                  | true    | When this setting is enabled, DiscordConnector will create a file in the game root directory "records.json" where it will record the number of times each player joins, leaves, dies, shouts or pings. If this is set to false, DiscordConnector will not keep a record of number of times each player does something it alerts to. If this is false, it takes precendent over the "Send leaderboard updates" setting and no leaderboards will get sent. |
| Send leaderboard updates       | false   | If you set this to true, that will enable DiscordConnector to send a leaderboard for stats to Discord on the set interval                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Enable Discord Bot Integration | false   | Enable this setting to allow Discord Bot integration with this plugin. See the [-bot.cfg](#bot-integration) file for all the config options related to this integration. When this is turned on, a listening HTTP webhook opens on a port specified in the config. This enables the Discord bot to communicate with this plugin (and the server).                                                                                                        |

## Messages

Filename `games.nwest.valheim.discordconnector-messages.cfg`

All of the message options support having multiple messages defined in a semicolon (`;`) separated list. If you have multiple messages defined for these settings, one gets chosen at random when DiscordConnector decides to send the corresponding message.

If you wanted to have a couple different messages for when a player dies (always chosen at random), you could simply set the config value like this:

```
Player Death Message = %PLAYER_NAME% has died a beautiful death!;%PLAYER_NAME% went to their end with honor!;%PLAYER_NAME% died.
```

### Messages.Server

In the server messages, anywhere in the message you can use the special string `%PUBLICIP%` which will be replaced with the public IP address of the server when sent.

### Messages.Players

In the player messages, anywhere in the message you put `%PLAYER_NAME%`, when the message is sent it will be replaced with that player's name.

| Option               | Default                            | Description                                                                                                                                  |

| Player Leave Message | `%PLAYER_NAME% has left.`          | The message that will be sent when a player leaves the server.                                                                               |

### Messages.PlayerFirsts

In the player messages, anywhere in the message you put `%PLAYER_NAME%`, when the message is sent it will be replaced with that player's name.

| Option                     | Default                                                       | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Messages.Events

In the event messages, anywhere in the message you can use the string vars `%EVENT_START_MSG%` and `%EVENT_END_MSG%` (or `%EVENT_MSG%` which is uses the start message when the event starts and the end message when the event ends.) ~~You can use `%PLAYERS%` to include a comma separated list of players who are in the event area (this likely will be empty if you include it when the event is paused).~~

!!! warning "%PLAYERS% variable removed in 1.4.0"

    Due to how the server keeps track of where players are (only if they are sharing location), the `%PLAYERS%` variable has been disabled indefinitely until a reliable way to gather player positions is developed.


| Option                | Default                                                                                          | Description                                                               |

## Toggles

Filename `games.nwest.valheim.discordconnector-toggles.cfg`

The toggle configuration is a collection of on/off switches for all the message types and all the extra data that can be sent with them. It's broken up into 3 sections, "Toggles.Messages" which turns on or off each type of message, "Toggles.Positions" which turns on or off sending player coordinates with messages, "Toggles.Stats" which turns on or off collection of individual stats and "Toggles.Leaderboards" which turns on or off what stats to send with the leaderboard updates
